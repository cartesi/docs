# App-Chains

Cartesi enables application developers to build and deploy app-specific rollups, in other words, Cartesi App-Chains. Built on top of the Cartesi Rollups framework, these app-chains allow developers to deploy complex, high-performance decentralized applications (dApps) without sacrificing decentralization or security and overcome the limitations of general-purpose Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains.
By isolating application logic from the base layer, Cartesi App-Chains provide a scalable and customizable execution environment that supports familiar programming stacks, such as Linux, and heavy computational workloads that are infeasible on-chain.

## Why App-chains?

#### Scalability and Performance

General-purpose blockchains(such as Ethereum) are shared by thousands of applications, which compete for limited blockspace and computational resources. This often leads to network congestion, high gas fees and delayed transaction finality. By contrast, App-Chains are dedicated rollups tailored to a single application, eliminating resource contention and enabling optimized throughput and cost control.

#### Application-Level Customization

Different dApps may have very different requirements for throughput, finality, State size and history and interactivity with users or other chains. With Cartesi App-Chains, developers have the freedom to define custom data availability strategies, use application-specific finality mechanisms, pick a consensus model and choose execution logic and libraries that best fit their needs.

## Composability and Interoperability

Cartesi App-Chains can interoperate with the Ethereum ecosystem and other chains, albeit with some constraints. Each app-chain is logically isolated but can use the base layer contracts(rollups-contracts) to share messages. Messaging across app-chains or between an app-chain and another dApp (like an L1 Uniswap pool) may require developers to build custom bridges or relayers.

## Bridging Assets

Migrating assets from the base layer(Layer 1 or Layer 2) requires the user to interact with the pre-deployed Portal smart contracts of the rollups infrastructure. For the security and consistency across the app-chain, it becomes necessary for the application developers to only accept assets received from the portal contracts. 

For instance, to **deposit assets**, the client makes a request to a dedicated portal smart contract. The portal contract then submits this request to the generic input contract of the rollups, which is then finally read by the node. This gives a representation of your assets on the app-chain. 

**Withdrawal of assets**, on the other hand, works when the application creates a special kind of  output called *voucher*. As discussed in the prior optimistic rollups section, this output must be validated before its execution. Note that while deposits are near instant, withdrawals can take time(dependent on epoch duration) before a user sees it in their base layer wallet.

## Application Deployment

Cartesi App-Chains are designed to be EVM-compatible, meaning they can seamlessly integrate with the Ethereum ecosystem and smart contract infrastructure. This allows Cartesiâ€™s on-chain components - the rollups contracts - to be deployed across any EVM-compatible chain.

Cartesi App-Chains can be deployed on:
- Layer 1 (Ethereum): For maximum security and decentralization, especially for apps handling high-value assets.

- Layer 2 Rollups (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum, Base): For reduced gas costs and faster transaction finality while retaining strong security guarantees.

This gives developers flexibility to optimize for cost, performance, and user reach depending on the application's needs. You can start building your app-chain in minutes with the quickstart guide here.
