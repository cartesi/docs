## GPG Verify smart contract

The implementation of this dApp's smart contract will naturally follow the same structure of the [previous tutorials](../calculator/full-dapp.md). Namely, it will define input drives containing the necessary data and provide methods to instantiate a Cartesi Compute computation using that data and then retrieve the corresponding result.

To that end, create a file called `GpgVerify.sol` in the `gpg-verify/contracts` directory, with the following content:

As detailed in the [previous section](../gpg-verify/cartesi-machine.md#full-machine-implementation), our dApp's Cartesi Machine specifies two input flash drives, one for an arbitrary document and another for an associated digital signature that asserts the authenticity and integrity of the document's contents. This is reflected in the `drives` definition within the `instantiate` method, which in this implementation establishes a total limit of 1024 bytes (log<sub>2</sub> size `10`) for each input drive content.

In the code above, the input data itself is arbitrarily defined so as to match the test data we used [before](../gpg-verify/ext2-gpg.md#test-data). However, as discussed in the [preceding section](../gpg-verify/cartesi-machine.md), the actual data submitted to the Cartesi Machine is required to have its content length encoded in each drive's four initial bytes. This is achieved by calling the method `prependDataWithContentLength` and using that method's output in the computation instantiation.

## Deployment and execution

With the smart contract implemented, it's time to compile and deploy it to the local network within our [development environment](../compute-env.md). Using Hardhat, as in the [other tutorials](../helloworld/deploy-run.md#deployment), we'll start by adding a file named `01_contracts.ts` to the `gpg-verify/deploy` directory and inserting the following code into it:

```javascript
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
import { DeployFunction } from "hardhat-deploy/types";

const func: DeployFunction = async (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) => {
  const { deployments, getNamedAccounts } = hre;
  const { deploy, get } = deployments;
  const { deployer } = await getNamedAccounts();

  const CartesiCompute = await get("CartesiCompute");
  await deploy("GpgVerify", {
    from: deployer,
    log: true,
    args: [CartesiCompute.address],
  });
};

export default func;
```

Then, deploy the contract by typing:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network localhost
```

After the contract is compiled and deployed, we can enter Hardhat's console and instantiate a GPG verification computation for the Cartesi Compute nodes associated with the development environment's addresses for `alice` and `bob`:

```javascript
npx hardhat console --network localhost
> { alice, bob } = await getNamedAccounts()
> gpg = await ethers.getContract("GpgVerify")
> tx = await gpg.instantiate([alice, bob])
```

Finally, after some time it will possible to query the GPG verification result by calling the `getResult` method for the computation's index:

```javascript
> index = (await tx.wait()).events[0].data
> result = await gpg.getResult(index)
[
  true,
  false,
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  '0x300a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
]
```

Recalling that the output of the Cartesi Machine's [execution script](../gpg-verify/cartesi-machine.md#final-execution-script) corresponds to the `gpg` tool's exit status, we must interpret the result data as an ASCII value that can represent success (`"0"`), failure (`"1"`), or other values for errors. This can be done by using `ethers` to print the output data as a string:

```javascript
> console.log(ethers.utils.toUtf8String(result[3]))
0
```

Which indicates "success" - or, in other words, that the provided document is indeed guaranteed to have been produced and adequately signed by someone in possession of the private key for `compute.tutorials@cartesi.io`, and that the document's data has not been tampered.

Should you change the `document` declaration in the smart contract, the output would become `"1"` (i.e., "failure"). Additionally, changing the data for the `signature` variable would either also lead to failure (i.e., signature no longer matches) or possibly to an error, in the case that the data no longer represents a valid digital signature. In this case, a different non-zero result would be retrieved.

Although fully functional, there is still one important aspect of our dApp that can render it unusable for many real-world scenarios: how the input data is fed into the computation. Indeed, the code above, which uses _direct drives_, implies that the document whose signature is being verified must be directly available to the smart contract as a `bytes` object. This is unfortunately not a really scalable solution, given the storage limitations and accompanying high costs of blockchains like Ethereum. As such, in the next section we will cover a couple of Cartesi Compute features that can tackle this issue to allow dApps to process larger volumes of data.
