8. Set an allowance for that particular pool, click on the button "Approve", and then confirm the transaction via Metamask. The allowance is the maximum amount of token the pool smart contract can transfer out of your wallet. You can set it to any value you want, your wallet amount, less or more.

## Unstaking

Whenever you decide, you can unstake a specific amount of your tokens or all of them and withdraw back to your wallet. You just need to navigate to the particular pool page and click on the button **Unstake**:
