Cartesi Rollups are app-specific execution environments that can be deployed as L2, L3, or sovereign rollups. It's not your typical L1 blockchain, so the idea of a "Mainnet launch" is slightly different. What goes to mainnet are the dApps built using Cartesi! And with the launch of the Honeypot dApp, Cartesi Rollups is officially ready for mainnet!

## About Mainnet 

Now that Cartesi has reached a Mainnet Ready stage, developers can build dApps with Cartesi Rollups and deploy on Ethereum, Optimism, and Arbitrum Mainnets!

At this first stage, the validation remains permissive, with no support for disputes; however, progress in implementing this is already underway.

## Undiscovered Bugs

The codebase may contain some undiscovered vulnerabilities that might put user funds at risk.

Developers and users should factor this risk into their decision to use Cartesi Rollups and decide how much of their value to entrust to the system.

## Security


The Cartesi Rollups infrastructure is being built based on careful design decisions and a robust code review process that aligns with the mainstream dogma of blockchain technology.

When it comes to dApp safety, developers must also implement the same level of concern in their process. A culture of code reviews, auditing, and extensively testing their code is paramount to avoid hacks or bugs that could lead to user funds being lost.

**The Honeypot** is a dApp designed to demonstrate Cartesi Rollups’ security capabilities.

As the Honeypot is tested and fortified, users and developers will have increased confidence in the security of Cartesi Rollups. Want to help test the security of Cartesi Rollups? [Try your hand at cracking the Honeypot](https://honeypot.cartesi.io/).


## Scams
Like Ethereum, Cartesi Rollups are permissionless—anybody can deploy any smart contract code. You can interact with contracts on Cartesi Rollups precisely as you do with Ethereum, but only if you’ve independently verified that the application is secure.
