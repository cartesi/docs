## Migrating from Cartesi Rollups Node v1.4 to v1.5.x

Release `v1.5.0` introduces a critical change in how epochs are closed in the Cartesi Rollups Node, transitioning from a **timestamp-based system to a block number-based system**.

Epoch closure is now determined by the `CARTESI_EPOCH_LENGTH` environment variable (in blocks) instead of `CARTESI_EPOCH_DURATION` (in seconds).

```plaintext
CARTESI_EPOCH_LENGTH = CARTESI_EPOCH_DURATION / BLOCK_TIME
```

Where `BLOCK_TIME` is the time to generate a block in the target network.

**Example**: If a block is generated every 12 seconds and `CARTESI_EPOCH_DURATION` is set to 86400 seconds (24 hours), `CARTESI_EPOCH_LENGTH = 86400 / 12 = 7200`

### Option 1: Redeploy all contracts

Redeploy all contracts and your application with the new configuration.

Refer to the [self-hosted deployment guide](../deployment/self-hosted.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

:::caution
Redeploying creates a new application instance. All previous inputs, outputs, claims, and funds locked in the application contract will remain associated with the old application address.
:::

### Option 2: Replace Application's History

This process allows inputs, outputs, and locked funds to remain unchanged but is more involved.

:::note
A new _History_ will have no claims. Upon restarting the node with a new _History_, previous claims will be resubmitted, incurring additional costs for the _Authority_ owner.
:::

:::caution
Instances of the [_History_](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-contracts/blob/v1.2.0/onchain/rollups/contracts/history/History.sol) contract from [rollups-contracts v1.2.0](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-contracts/releases/tag/v1.2.0) may be used simultaneously by several applications through their associated _Authority_ instance.
Application owners must consider that and exercise care when performing the steps listed below.
:::

It's recommended to use the deterministic deployment functions available in the Rollups contracts.

#### 1. Define the environment variables

- `SALT`: A random 32-byte value for the deterministic deployment functions.
- `RPC_URL`: The RPC endpoint to be used.
- `MNEMONIC`: The mnemonic phrase for the Authority owner's wallet (other wallet options may be used).
- `HISTORY_FACTORY_ADDRESS`: The address of a valid HistoryFactory instance.
- `AUTHORITY_ADDRESS`: The address of the Authority instance used by the application.

  :::note environment variables
  A `HistoryFactory` is deployed at `0x1f158b5320BBf677FdA89F9a438df99BbE560A26` for all supported networks, including Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and their respective Sepolia-based testnets.

#### 2. Instantiate a New _History_

This is a two-step process. First calculate the address of the new History. After that, the new instance of History may be created.

- To calculate the address of a new _History_ contract call the `calculateHistoryAddress(address,bytes32)(address)` function with the help of Foundry's Cast:

  ```shell
  cast call \
    --trace --verbose \
    $HISTORY_FACTORY_ADDRESS \
    "calculateHistoryAddress(address,bytes32)(address)" \
    $AUTHORITY_ADDRESS \
    $SALT \
    --rpc-url "$RPC_URL"
  ```

  If the command executes successfully, it will display the address of the new History contract. Store this address in the environment variable `NEW_HISTORY_ADDRESS` for later use.

- Create a new instance of _History_ may be created by calling function `newHistory(address,bytes32)`:

  ```shell
  cast send \
  --json \
  --mnemonic "$MNEMONIC" \
  $HISTORY_FACTORY_ADDRESS \
  "newHistory(address,bytes32)(History)" \
  $AUTHORITY_ADDRESS \
  $SALT \
  --rpc-url "$RPC_URL"
  ```

  The `cast send` command will fail if Cast does not recognize the _History_ type during execution. In such cases, replace _History_ with `address` as the return type for `newHistory()` and execute the command again.


 The `cast send` command may also fail due to gas estimation issues. To circumvent this, provide gas constraints with the `--gas-limit` parameter (e.g., `--gas-limit 7000000`).


#### 3. Replace the _History_

Ensure the environment variables from the previous step are set, including `NEW_HISTORY_ADDRESS`, which should have the address of the new History.

To replace the _History_ used by the _Authority_, run this command:

```shell
cast send \
    --json \
    --mnemonic "$MNEMONIC" \
    "$AUTHORITY_ADDRESS" \
    "setHistory(address)" \
    "$NEW_HISTORY_ADDRESS" \
    --rpc-url "$RPC_URL"
```

After replacing the _History_, update the `CARTESI_CONTRACTS_HISTORY_ADDRESS` in the application configuration with the new _History_ address. Then, upgrade the Cartesi Rollups Node as usual.

When the Cartesi Rollups Node restarts, it processes all existing inputs, recalculates the epochs, and sends the claims to the new _History_ based on the updated configuration.
