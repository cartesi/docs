# Introduction

This tutorial is intended for Cartesi DApp developers to understand the Espresso integration with Cartesi Rollups and how to port traditional Cartesi Rollups applications so that inputs can be submitted via Espresso, instead of necessarily requiring a transaction on the base layer.

[Espresso System](https://espressosys.com/) provides a decentralized sequencer and data availability system, which can be very useful to scale layer-2 rollup solutions. Cartesi provides an app-specific rollups solution which could particularly benefit from both.
