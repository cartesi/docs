title: CartesiDApp

The **CartesiDApp** contract acts as the base layer incarnation of a dApp running on the execution layer. The dApp is hereby able to interact with other smart contracts through the execution of [vouchers](/cartesi-rollups/1.0/main-concepts/#vouchers)
and the validation of [notices](/cartesi-rollups/1.0/main-concepts/#notices). These outputs are generated by the [dApp back-end](/cartesi-rollups/1.0/dapp-architecture/#back-end) on the execution layer and can be proven in the base layer thanks to claims submitted by a consensus contract.

A **voucher** is a one-time message call to another contract. It can encode asset transfers, approvals,
or any other message call that doesn't require Ether to be sent along. A voucher will only be consumed
if the underlying message call succeeds (that is, it doesn't revert). Furthermore, the return data of
the message call is discarded entirely. As a protective measure against reentrancy attacks, nested
voucher executions are prohibited.

A **notice**, on the other hand, constitutes an arbitrary piece of data that can be proven any number of times.
On their own, they do not trigger any type of contract-to-contract interaction.
Rather, they merely serve to attest off-chain results, e.g. which player won a particular chess match.

Every dApp is subscribed to a consensus contract, and governed by a single address, the owner.
The consensus has the power of submitting claims, which, in turn, are used to validate vouchers and notices.
Meanwhile, the owner has complete power over the dApp, as it can replace the consensus at any time.
Therefore, the users of a dApp must trust both the consensus and the dApp owner.

The dApp developer can choose whichever ownership and consensus models it wants.

Examples of dApp ownership models include:

- no owner (address zero)
- individual signer (externally-owned account)
- multiple signers (multi-sig)
- DAO (decentralized autonomous organization)
- self-owned dApp (off-chain governance logic)

See `IConsensus` for examples of consensus models.

This contract inherits the following OpenZeppelin contracts.

- `Ownable`
- `ERC721Holder`
- `ERC1155Holder`
- `ReentrancyGuard`
