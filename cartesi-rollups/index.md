    title: Grokking Cartesi Rollups
---

Cartesi provides a framework for building decentralized applications using mainstream development tools and having them all on the blockchain.

Cartesi Rollups provide a modular execution layer, enabling individual dApps to have their dedicated rollup app chains with dedicated CPUs. This ensures that each dApp can perform its computations efficiently without competing for resources with others.

Unlike shared VM environments, Cartesi Rollups prevent resource conflicts among dApps, ensuring cost predictability and allowing developers to focus on their core application functionality.

Cartesi Rollups also introduces the concept of a full-fledged operating system within the rollup environment.

This means that developers can leverage industry-grade software tooling and libraries, just as you do in traditional software development, making it easier to bring your decentralized applications to life
