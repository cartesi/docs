Cartesi Rollups, which are app-specific execution environments that can be deployed as an L2, L3, or sovereign rollups. It's not your typical L1 blockchain, so the idea of a "Mainnet launch" is slightly different. What goes to mainnet are the dApps built using Cartesi! And with the launch of the Honeypot dApp, Cartesi Rollups is officially ready for mainnet (beta)!

## About Mainnet Beta

Now that Cartesi has reached a Mainnet Ready stage, developers can build dApps with Cartesi Rollups and deploy on Ethereum, Optimism, and Arbitrum Mainnets!

At this first stage, the validation remains permissive, with no support for disputes; however, progress in implementing this is already underway.

## Undiscovered Bugs

While Cartesi Rollups is in the beta stage of development, the codebase may contain some undiscovered vulnerabilities that might put user funds at risk.

Developers and users should factor this risk into their decision to use Cartesi Rollups and decide how much of their value to entrust to the system.

## Security
So, what steps are we taking to keep user funds safe? Honeypot is a dApp designed to prove Cartesi Rollups' security.

As the [Honeypot](https://honeypot.cartesi.io/) is tested and fortified, users and developers will have increased confidence in the security of Cartesi’s tech when launching and using new apps that hold real assets.

## Scams
Cartesi Rollups, like Ethereum, are permissionless - anybody can deploy any smart contract code they want. Treat interacting with contracts on Cartesi Rollups precisely as you do with Ethereum, only doing so if you’ve independently verified that the application is secure.
