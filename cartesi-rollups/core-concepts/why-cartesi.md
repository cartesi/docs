Cartesi is an open-source project at the forefront of blockchain innovation.
 
Cartesi Machine lies at the heart of our mission, representing a significant leap towards a modular blockchain future. With the Cartesi machine, we are capable of rollups that can process 100x more than the EVM, using a Linux based execution environment, which gives us access to tools and all the languages used by traditional backends.

The Cartesi project is stewarded by intelligent minds from all over the world â€“ working to empower developers with unparalleled computational scalability and flexibility.

By breaking free from EVM constraints, developers can leverage any programming language or library available for Linux, unlocking the potential for sophisticated decentralized applications that were once deemed impractical within the confines of existing blockchain frameworks.

Whether you're a seasoned blockchain developer seeking to push the boundaries of innovation or a newcomer looking to explore the vast potential of decentralized technology, Cartesi provides the resources and support you need to innovate and succeed.
