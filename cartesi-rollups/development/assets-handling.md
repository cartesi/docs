Assets exist on the base layer, where they have actual meaning and value.

As with any execution layer solution, a Cartesi dApp that wants to manipulate assets needs a secure way of "teleporting" the assets from the base layer to the execution layer and then a way to "teleport" them back to the base layer.

Currently, Cartesi Rollups support the following types of assets:

- [Ether (ETH)](../api/json-rpc/portals/EtherPortal.md)
- [ERC-20](../api/json-rpc/portals/ERC20Portal.md)
- [ERC-721](../api/json-rpc/portals/ERC721Portal.md)
- [ERC-1155 Single](../api/json-rpc/portals/ERC1155SinglePortal.md)
- [ERC-1155 Batch](../api/json-rpc/portals/ERC1155BatchPortal.md)

The Portal contracts, part of the on-chain components, are responsible for teleporting assets from the base layer blockchain to a Cartesi dApp. You can think of a Portal as a bank account owned by the off-chain machine.

## Deposits

When an asset is deposited, the Portal contract sends an input to the dApp, describing the type of asset, amount, receivers, and some data the depositor might want the dApp to read. This allows deposits and instructions to be sent as a single L1 interaction.

Deposit an asset using Sunodo:

```shell
$ sunodo send
Select send sub-command:
❯ Send ERC-20 deposit to the application.
  Send ERC-721 deposit to the application.
  Send ether deposit to the application.
```

## Withdrawals

Before you make a withdrawal request to your dApp, the first thing to do is call a function in the `dAppAddressRelay` contract that allows you to inform the off-chain machine of the address of the dApp contract in a trustless and permissionless way.

Without relaying the address of your dApp, the withdrawal request will fail, and a voucher creation will fail.

You can do this relay call which simply adds the dApp address as an input via a custom frontend, sunodo, or Cast.

Using the most convenient approach, Sunodo, here is how you can relay the address of your dApp.

```shell
$ sunodo send
? Select send sub-command (Use arrow keys)
❯ Send DApp address input to the application.
```

Withdrawal requests can now be made. It is important to note that adding vouchers(making withdrawal requests) does not conclude the asset transfer.

These vouchers must be executed using the `executeVoucher()` function from the CartesiDApp contract.
