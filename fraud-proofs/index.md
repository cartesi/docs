# Overview

Welcome to the documentation for Cartesi’s Fraud Proof System, focused on the implementation of the **Permissionless Refereed Tournament (PRT)** and its real-world application in the **Honeypot dApp**.

This section is designed to help you understand how Cartesi enables secure and decentralized verification of off-chain computations through fraud proofs. These docs are targeted for researchers and builders who want to dive deep into the implementation of Cartesi's fraud proof system. For beginners, we recommend starting with the [Fraud Proof Basics](./fraud-proof-basics/introduction) section.

## Scope
- The fundamentals of fraud proofs and their role in rollups
- How Cartesi’s Permissionless Refereed Tournament (PRT) works
- The architecture and contracts behind PRT
- How the Honeypot dApp integrates with and demonstrates PRT
- A reference to PRT's core and consensus layer APIs

:::note Work in progress
This documentation focuses on the PRT implementation of Dave - the leading fraud proof system of Cartesi. Improvements in PRT will be part of the roadmap of Dave system and will be added as it matures.
